User Group Field is a Craft CMS plugin with a field type that lets you select one or more user groups.

## Documentation
Visit the [User Group Field Plugin page](https://verbb.io/craft-plugins/user-group-field) for all documentation, guides, pricing and developer resources.

### Caching Craft::$app->getUserGroups()->getAllGroups(); request.
By default `Craft::$app->getUserGroups()->getAllGroups();` is called for every element that has a user group field, requesting all the groups which won't change between entries, unless it's a CP request and a user group is added, edited or removed. 
This data can be cached per url by adding a flag to the following calls - 
`{% set groups = entry.userGroupFieldHandle.getGroups($cache = true) %}`

`{% if entry.userGroupFieldHandle.inGroup(currentUser, $cache = true) %}`

`{% if entry.userGroupFieldHandle.canAccess(currentUser, $cache = true) %}`
